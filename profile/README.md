## About Us

We are the **Industrial Vision Laboratory (InViLab)** at the University of Antwerp, a multidisciplinary research group pioneering machine vision solutions for industry and society. We develop cutting-edge imaging techniques for smart health, pollution monitoring, heritage conservation, and sustainable materials.

Our mission is to guide companies towards realizing better quality control, automation, and safety through state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques. We bring together experts in engineering, mathematics, physics, and chemistry to push the boundaries of machine vision and AI.

## üöÄ Featured Project: GenPyCam

**The World's First Generic Camera SDK Providing Quick and Easy Camera Capturing in Python**

> **üéâ Coming Soon!** GenPyCam will be released publicly soon. We are finalizing our toolbox and preparing for the beta release. Stay tuned for updates!

GenPyCam is our flagship open-source toolbox that simplifies industrial camera integration with just four lines of code:

```python
import genpycam as gpc
camera = gpc.Camera()
camera.start()
image = camera.get_image()
```

### Key Features:
- **Universal Compatibility**: Supports Allied Vision Technologies, Basler, FLIR, IDS, IFM, Specim, Xenics, Optris, Seek Thermal, and many more
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows and Linux
- **Cross-Protocol**: Supports Ethernet, USB, and non-GenICam standards
- **Robust Error Handling**: Over 10,000 lines of connection error handling code
- **Easy Integration**: Install like any other Python library with pip

### Use Cases:
- **Prototyping & Technology Flexibility**: Rapid switching between camera technologies
- **In-situ Testing & Reliability**: Real-time quality control in production environments
